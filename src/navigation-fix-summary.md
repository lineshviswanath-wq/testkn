# DABBA SAVE Navigation Fix âœ…

## Issue Identified:
The "DABBA SAVE" navigation was not working properly because the App.tsx routing was rendering individual components instead of using the dedicated `DabbaSavePage` component.

## Root Cause:
In `/App.tsx`, line 79-87, the 'dabbasave' navigation case was configured as:
```tsx
{navigation.currentView === 'dabbasave' && (
  <>
    <HeroSection />
    <DepositCalculator />
    <MicroDepositsSection />
    <PartnerBanksCard />
    <ContactSection />
  </>
)}
```

But the `DabbaSavePage` component was already imported and available, providing a more complete and tailored experience.

## Solution Applied:
âœ… **Fixed App.tsx routing** (line 79):
```tsx
// BEFORE
{navigation.currentView === 'dabbasave' && (
  <>
    <HeroSection />
    <DepositCalculator />
    <MicroDepositsSection />
    <PartnerBanksCard />
    <ContactSection />
  </>
)}

// AFTER  
{navigation.currentView === 'dabbasave' && <DabbaSavePage />}
```

âœ… **Cleaned up unused import** - Removed unused `HeroSectionWithContact` import

## Verification:
- âœ… Header.tsx correctly calls `handleNavClick('dabbasave')` for DABBA SAVE button
- âœ… Navigation context properly handles 'dabbasave' view  
- âœ… DabbaSavePage component exists and includes:
  - HeroSectionWithContact
  - Key Features Section  
  - Savings Plans Section
  - DepositCalculator
  - MicroDepositsSection
  - Benefits Section
  - Success Stories Section
  - PartnerBanksCard
  - ContactSection

## Result:
ðŸŽ¯ **DABBA SAVE navigation now properly routes to the dedicated DabbaSavePage component**, providing users with the complete DABBA SAVE experience instead of just generic components.

## Files Modified:
- `/App.tsx` - Fixed navigation routing and cleaned up imports
